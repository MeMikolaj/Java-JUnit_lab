# Java-JUnit_lab
One of the labs at the University of Toronto.

I created __Point__ object (object with data (x, y)). It is possible to check euclidean distance between 2 Point objects and they have their own hashcode.

Furthermore, I created __Triangle__ objects containing of 3 Point objects. It is possible to calculate the perimeter of the triangle and check if the triangle is equiliteral.

Then, then __lab4test.java__ file contains all the JUnit functions to fully test the code.
